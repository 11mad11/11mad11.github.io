# Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, built using AstroJS. This project marks my first experience with Astro, a framework I chose for its unique approach to web development. Unlike many other frameworks, Astro focuses on optimizing performance by delivering as little JavaScript as possible to the client, which aligns perfectly with my goals for this site.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this website is to serve as a platform where I can showcase my personal and professional(when I can) projects. In addition to displaying my work, I aim to incorporate interactive demos to give visitors a hands-on experience with some of the tools, concepts, or projects Iâ€™ve developed.

## Future Plans

- Portfolio: Highlight my projects in detail, including descriptions, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
- Interactive Demos: Add live, interactive elements to demonstrate the functionality of my projects.
- Blog: Share insights, tutorials, and lessons learned during my development journey.
- Continuous Improvements: Experiment with new features and technologies to keep the site modern and engaging.

## Why AstroJS?

AstroJS stood out to me because of its innovative approach to web development, which prioritizes performance and developer flexibility. Its component-based architecture and support for multiple front-end frameworks make it a powerful tool for creating fast, modern websites.
