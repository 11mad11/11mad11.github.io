## Welcome!

I'm a versatile developer and technician specializing in hardware and software solutions, with a focus on safety, automation, and user-centric design. Based in Quebec, I bring over six years of hands-on experience in maintenance and automation, backed by a strong foundation in both programming and engineering principles.

My journey has been rooted in making technology more accessible and safe, from designing custom safety devices and modernizing machinery to creating web solutions and IoT applications using TypeScript and Rust. I’m especially passionate about projects that blend hardware and software, like smart home automation and industrial safety systems.

I believe in practical, reliable solutions that don’t just meet technical standards but prioritize user needs and safety. Whether it's collaborating on a new automation system, designing a web app, or consulting on hardware integration, I approach every project with an open mind and a commitment to quality and innovation.

Let’s bring your ideas to life!
